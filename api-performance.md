# API Performance Debugging and Optimization

## Objective
The goal is to identify and resolve performance issues with an API experiencing slow response times under high traffic. Specifically, the API's "complete session" endpoint is receiving 20,000 requests per minute.

## Step 1: Initial Investigation

1. **Check Logs**:  
   I will begin by reviewing the logs for some of the requests. This will help me understand where the issue may lie and guide me on where to dig deeper.

2. **Analyze Server Resources**:  
   I will assess the available system resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) to determine whether the server is struggling to meet the incoming request load. This will help identify whether the bottleneck is related to resource limitations.

3. **Code Review**:  
   I will also examine the code for any inefficiencies that could be contributing to the server's load. This includes checking for unnecessary computations or synchronous tasks that could be optimized.

## Step 2: Offloading Heavy Computations

1. **Asynchronous Processing**:  
   If any heavy computations are being performed synchronously, I will explore the possibility of offloading them to background workers. This can be done using task queues like **Redis** or **RabbitMQ**. Offloading time-consuming tasks will allow the API to respond more quickly to incoming requests without being bogged down by lengthy computations.

## Step 3: Analyzing Database Queries

1. **Check Slow Queries**:  
   A common cause of slow API performance is inefficient database queries. I will start by reviewing the slow query logs to identify any queries that may be taking a long time and negatively impacting performance.

2. **Test Slow Queries**:  
   If I identify any slow queries, I will replicate these queries and run them individually to assess their performance. I will then use the `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` commands to identify any full table scans or inefficient operations.

3. **Query Optimization**:  
   Based on the information gathered from the `EXPLAIN` output, I will look for ways to optimize the queries. This may involve redesigning the query or adding indexes to improve performance.

4. **Database Write Performance**:  
   I will also investigate if the issue is related to writing to the database. If writing to the database is taking time, I will consider revisiting the indexes to remove unnecessary ones. Additionally, I will evaluate the possibility of denormalization to improve write performance.

5. **Batching Database Writes**:  
   Instead of writing to the database one record at a time, I will consider batching the writes. This will help reduce the overhead and improve the performance of database operations under high traffic.

## Step 4: Load Balancing

1. **Server Load Assessment**:  
   If server resources are found to be under significant pressure, I will consider load balancing the API to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

2. **Horizontal Scaling**:  
   If the traffic load is high during specific times, we can scale horizontally by spinning up multiple instances of the API during peak hours. Once the traffic reduces, we can scale back down to optimize resource usage and cost.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, I will first identify the root causes of the performance issue, then implement optimizations needed.
